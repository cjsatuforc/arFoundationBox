# arFoundationBox
## Unity project utilizing AR Foundation for display of Autodesk Fusion 360 assets

This Unity project will build to either iOS or Android by utilizing AR Foundation

* Clone the repo and open it in Unity 2017.3 or later
* Build platform should be Android by default, if not, change it in build settings or if you desire to build to an iPhone/iPad...
* Change your build platform to iOS (Unity for macOS and XCode 10 required)
* Ensure that your device is setup for developer builds

This version uses an experimental build of AR Foundation (v1-preview22)
Any console errors are likely due to changes in the AR Foundation framework which can be updated from the Unity Package Mananger in the Window menu.
